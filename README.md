# Calibre EPUB QuickLook Extension

A macOS QuickLook extension for EPUB files that integrates with Calibre's existing infrastructure.

## Overview

This project adds EPUB QuickLook support directly to Calibre by creating a Swift QuickLook Extension that communicates with Calibre's existing `quicklook_service()` backend.

## Why Calibre Integration?

1. **Proven Infrastructure**: Calibre already has `quicklook_service()` built specifically for this purpose
2. **Community Welcome**: Kovid (Calibre founder) explicitly welcomes community contribution  
3. **Better Solution**: Leverages Calibre's mature EPUB parsing and multi-format support
4. **Long-term Maintenance**: Benefits from Calibre's established development team

## Technical Architecture

- **Backend**: Calibre's existing `quicklook_service()` (Unix socket + JSON)
- **Frontend**: Swift QuickLook Extension using WKWebView
- **Integration**: Add QuickLook Extension target to Calibre's build system
- **Distribution**: Upstream contribution to Calibre repository

## Implementation Plan

1. **Research Phase**
   - [ ] Fork Calibre repository
   - [ ] Study `quicklook_service()` implementation in `calibre.srv.render_book`
   - [ ] Understand Calibre's build system and contribution guidelines

2. **Development Phase**
   - [ ] Create Swift QuickLook Extension
   - [ ] Implement Unix socket communication with Calibre backend
   - [ ] Add WKWebView-based HTML rendering
   - [ ] Integrate with Calibre's macOS build system

3. **Integration Phase**
   - [ ] Test with various EPUB formats
   - [ ] Submit PR to upstream Calibre repository
   - [ ] Work with Calibre team for integration

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ Research complete - Calibre's `quicklook_service()` verified working
- ‚úÖ Unix socket communication tested successfully  
- ‚úÖ Test EPUB processing confirmed
- üöß Swift QuickLook extension skeleton created
- ‚è≥ Socket client implementation in Swift needed
- ‚è≥ Xcode project setup pending

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- macOS 10.15+
- Calibre installed
- Xcode for QuickLook extension development

### Testing the Backend

1. Start Calibre's quicklook service:
   ```bash
   ./src/start_service.sh
   ```

2. In another terminal, test with sample EPUB:
   ```bash
   ./src/test_client.py
   ```

The service will generate HTML previews in a temporary directory.
